## 🧠 Abstract
The **WNEURA Project** is a computational neuroscience simulation designed to investigate the **"Cognitive Gap Theory."** It models the interaction between logarithmically increasing academic pressure (Weber-Fechner Law) and the biological limits of the human Prefrontal Cortex (PFC).

Using a stochastic Agent-Based Model (ABM), this simulation tracks **100 independent agents** over a **365-day period**, observing the emergent transition from strategic psychostimulant usage to chemical dependency. The model integrates biological noise, circadian rhythm disruption ("The Sleep Tax"), and receptor downregulation dynamics.

## 📂 Repository Contents

### 1. Source Code (`/src`)
The core simulation engine is built in Python and modularized for scientific reproducibility:

* **`agent.py`**: Contains the `StochasticAgent` class. Defines the neuro-biological state vector (PFC integrity, Nucleus Accumbens sensitivity, Amygdala activation) and the decision-making kernel.
* **`runner.py`**: The main simulation loop. Manages the longitudinal timeline ($T=365$), initializes the population with genetic variance, and records state transitions.
* **`analysis.py`**: Data visualization suite. Processes the raw CSV output and generates the academic plots (Seaborn/Matplotlib figures).

### 2. Visuals (`/plots`)
High-resolution outputs generated by the simulation:
* `Fig1_The_Trap.png`: The "Honeymoon Phase" dynamics.
* `Fig2_Sleep_Tax.png`: Correlation between drug use and sleep loss.
* `Fig3_Genetics.png`: Resilience failure analysis.
* `wneura_research_results.png`: **Master Dashboard** (Global population heatmap and stress analysis).

## 📊 Key Findings
* **The Inevitability of Collapse:** Under high external loads ($\mathcal{L}_{ext} > 0.6$), 98% of agents fail to maintain baseline inhibition, regardless of genetic willpower.
* **The Sleep Tax:** A correlation of $r = -0.84$ was observed between drug concentration and circadian disruption.
* **The Event Horizon:** Day 150 marks a critical "No-Return" threshold where neuro-adaptation renders natural recovery statistically improbable.
